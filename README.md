# ECA-Net-Replication
This repository provides a PyTorch-based replication of ECA-Net, focusing on understanding its lightweight channel attention mechanism rather than reproducing exact benchmark scores. The goal is to analyze the impact of efficient channel attention on convolutional feature representations.
